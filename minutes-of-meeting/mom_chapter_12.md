Hi everyone, sorry. I'm in the train so I won't be talking

I don't think I have ever seen Richard in quite such a vivid shirt before
Amdrew
I don't know if you have already talked about it, but for me the eye-opener/aha effect was on page 202, where he mentions that in a long dot expression, all of them are getters except the last one that is a setter. Thought that was particularly neat.
Amdrew
I thought that was surprising
Amdrew
rust has that as well
Amdrew
yeah rust has that as well

I also found the comment about property dispatch being dynamic really interesting
Amdrew
Kind of weird having to evaluate things on the left hand side of the = sign.
Amdrew
But obvious once you've done it.

Amdrew
yes exactly the value is evaluated.
Amdrew
I think it's because you're not determining it at 'compile' time, no?
Amdrew
where?
Amdrew
Note how I switched from talking about “properties” to “fields”. There is a subtle difference between the two. Fields are named bits of state stored directly in an instance. Properties are the named, uh, things, that a get expression may return. Every field is a property, but as we’ll see later, not every property is a field.

I don't really understand the difference if a function can be the value of a field
