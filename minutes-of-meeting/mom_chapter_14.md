UB !!!!
Aaron
Fortunately we have two solid, free, widely available compilers now. That was not always the case!
Aaron
malloc() vs aalloc()
Basil
alloca?
Aaron
Basil: yes
Patrick
yes, whenever the CPU processes a part of your code that is on the heap it gets transferred into the stack for that time.
Basil
That's where calloc comes into play :D
Andreas
@patrick only if you copy it into a local variable/buffer, otherwise the compiler will most likely load it directly from the heap (or work on it directly, depending on the assembly-operation)

oh ok.

@Amdrew, if you're used to assembler, the [] used to translate to the x86 lea instruction

Big-Endian = Big-Heads LOL
Aaron
Several RISC architectures can be booted in _either_ big-endian or little-endian mode.
Patrick
unsigned short
Basil
The fight between int vs unsigned in c++ goes deeper. The specified undefined behaviour for each of them is different, allowing for some different optimizations :)

like a managed memory pool, or better a circular buffer!
