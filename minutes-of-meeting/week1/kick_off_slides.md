## Why this book?

- comes highly recommended

## What should we expect?

- Intellectual stimulation
  - not immediately practical
- Understanding how things work under the hood

## What will we be doing

- creating a `simple` language (Lox) from scratch

- Starting from Chapter 4, we will be typing in, line-by line, our language.
  - each line will be explained
  - code will always work
---
## For next session (Jan 23)

- Read chapters 1, 2, 3
- setup IDE/makefiles for Java
- if you don't know C, learn C.

---

# Pace

- The difficulty of the homework will determine the pace
    - assuming that this can be done 'on the side', i.e. with a job/family

- we can change the pace if we go too fast/too slow
