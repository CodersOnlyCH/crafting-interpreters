Recommendation of youtube videos for learning C and not being scared of pointers. Guillermo will push to the repo.

### Andreas:

Idea to start with very simple command-line is good to get the basics, but at some point you will really want the
comfort of the IDE for debugging, especially for memory issues.

### patrick:

- recommendation EBNF as a grammar
